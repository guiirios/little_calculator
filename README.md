🧮 My Calculator








A clean and minimal calculator built with Python — focused on simplicity, logic, and learning.

🌟 Overview

My Calculator is a personal Python project that performs the four basic math operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — using a simple class-based structure.

It’s built with the idea of keeping code simple, readable, and educational, making it a great starting point for anyone learning Python or exploring Object-Oriented Programming.

⚙️ What It Can Do

➕ Add multiple numbers

➖ Subtract values in sequence

✖️ Multiply any amount of inputs

➗ Divide numbers progressively

🧠 Uses *args for flexible and dynamic input

🔄 Built with OOP principles for clarity and reusability

🧩 Core Concepts
💡 Concept	🔍 Description
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)	Structure and logic organized inside a class
*args	Handles multiple inputs dynamically
Loops	Iterate through inputs for calculations
Readable Logic	Simple code, easy to understand and modify
