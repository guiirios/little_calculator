# 🧮 Calculator in Python

A simple and clean **Python Calculator** class that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — while keeping a history of all calculations.  
This project was made to practice **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** concepts in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ **Addition**
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division**
- 🧾 **Operation history**
- 🧹 **Clear history method**

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

This project demonstrates:
- Use of the `__init__` constructor and `self`
- Handling of `*args` to allow multiple input values
- Encapsulation of behavior within methods
- Appending and managing a history list
- Use of Python built-in methods (like `.clear()`)

💡 Future Improvements

Add exponentiation and modulo operations

Implement error handling (e.g., division by zero)

Allow dynamic input through user interaction

Add a graphical or command-line interface
